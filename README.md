# Optics Simulation
## This is a simulation of light reflection on a curved mirror made in [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org).

![concave mirror](/ccv_mirror.png)
![convex mirror](/cvx_mirror.png)

## Usage
These values can be changed by replacing parameters of System class where it's called ( maybe on line 134)

* radius of mirror
* type of mirror
* number of rays
* width of light beam
* position of light beam

## You can use this code however you want, and improvement in code is appreciated.
